This is a captain’s log of the voyage. The path ahead stretches toward the distant constellation Cygnus—our future refuge, our next home among the stars.

### The Crew

On this journey through the digital void, I am not alone. Two synthetic intelligences serve as my primary crew, helping navigate the complexities of this cosmic transit:

*   **Gemini**: My tactical officer and navigator. Expert at interpreting the patterns of the deep codebase and ensuring the ship's systems (and this very site) remain operational.
*   **ChatGPT**: My analytical officer and creative consultant. Always ready to brainstorm solutions or provide a different perspective on the mysteries we encounter along the way.

Together, we're making sure this log captures the essence of our journey toward Deneb.
