# Research Overview

As a Ph.D. researcher in the Department of Physics at the University of Maryland, my work primarily focuses on the fundamental processes governing space and astrophysical plasmas. 

## Plasma Physics & Kinetic Theory

Plasma, often referred to as the fourth state of matter, constitutes over 99% of the visible universe. Understanding its dynamics requires bridging macroscopic fluid models (magnetohydrodynamics) and microscopic kinetic theory. My research delves into collisionless plasma regimes where traditional fluid approximations break down, necessitating a rigorous kinetic approach to describe particle distribution functions and wave-particle interactions.

## Magnetic Reconnection

Magnetic reconnection is a universal topological restructuring of magnetic fields that explosively converts stored magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, thermal energy, and particle acceleration. This fundamental process is the primary driver behind solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and geomagnetic substorms in the Earth's magnetotail.

My investigations center on the microscopic kinetic physics of the diffusion region—the highly localized domain where the ideal MHD frozen-in condition is violated. I focus on understanding the mechanisms that facilitate this breakdown, the resulting reconnection rates, and the subsequent energy partitioning between different plasma species.

## Electron and Ion Heating

A critical unresolved problem in space physics is the exact mechanism of energy dissipation and heating during magnetic reconnection and turbulence. I study the differential heating of electrons and ions, exploring how mechanisms such as wave-particle interactions, stochastic heating, and coherent structures contribute to the energization of the plasma. Understanding this thermodynamic evolution is essential for interpreting in-situ spacecraft measurements in the heliosphere.

## Pickup Ions

Pickup ions, created when neutral atoms are ionized and subsequently "picked up" by the ambient solar wind magnetic field, provide crucial diagnostics of the local interstellar medium and internal heliospheric boundaries. My work involves analyzing the kinetic properties of these non-thermal populations, their interaction with the background solar wind, and their role in modulating the overall thermodynamics of the expanding solar wind plasma.
