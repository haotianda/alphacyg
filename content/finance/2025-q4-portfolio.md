### Strategy Insight

The current allocation reflects a **Barbell Strategy**:
1.  **Growth Engine**: Significant exposure to AI and semiconductor leaders (NVDA, ASML) and massive software ecosystems (MSFT, GOOGL).
2.  **Defensive Anchor**: High-quality value (BRK.B, COST) and a substantial cash/short-term bond buffer (SGOV, BIL) to capitalize on market volatility and provide yield in a high-rate environment.
3.  **Income Generation**: Utilization of derivative-based income ETFs (JEPQ, QQQI) to reduce portfolio volatility while capturing premium income.
